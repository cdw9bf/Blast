##### Notes of the Control Structure ######


datatypes.py 
	|
	|- Contains the data structures
	    |-  line 
	|- Should be a header for all the other files

voxelize.py 
	|
	|- Finds center of voxel  () 
	|
	|- box()
	|	- First makes bounding box around brep 
	|	- Populates it with evenly spaced (according to shape of voxel) points to 
	|	  test whether or not they are in the voxel 
	|	- Copies the curves to the right starting and ending points 
	|	- Removes duplicate curves assuming that all the curves are lines 
	|	   (if they are non linear, then just the starting and ending point will not
	|		 sufficient to check their uniqueness)
	| 	# Notes: maybe break into smaller functions, such as finding center points of voxels 
	|     copying the cubes, then testing duplicates?
	

main.py
	|
	|- Contains the contents for the grasshopper script
	|- Should be copied right into the grasshopper for running everything else


	
	
	
	
	
	
	

	
	
	
	
	
##### Structure for the Scripts ##### 

main.py 
	|
	|- Goals:
	|	- Voxilize the form
	|	- Lay infill structures
	|		- Have ability to add different fills 
	|	- Break up by layer, find the path
	|		- Different paths will be needed
	|		- Cross hatch, left hand, regular grid, etc. 
	|	- Export Lines into grasshopper 
	|
	|
	|- Notes:
	|	- Break things into functions, different fill structures can be 
	|	  different files, that way it will be simple to add and change things
	
	
	
Where I am Currently:

sort list so that indexes match up
if # < 4:
	outside.append(edgePoint)
while not loop:
	
	

Next Steps:
- path finding through the middle layers and different stragies
